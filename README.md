In 1984, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International Telegraph and Telephone Consultative Committee (CCITT) published the Open Systems Interconnection Reference Model, more commonly known as the OSI model. The OSI model is a conceptual model which enables different computer systems to communicate using standard protocols. The model is so fundamental that it has become a universal language for computer networking. The model splits up a communication system into seven abstract layers, where each one stacked upon the last - like a stack of pancakes.
