# API Styles Fundamentals

If you only have a hammer, everything begins to look like a nail, but sticking with a single API style is limiting. Nowadays, a service or microservice has several APIs, and they must all be well-defined. You’ll examine the best types of APIs for your use cases as well as the design decisions you must make for RESTful APIs, GraphQL APIs, Websockets API, gRPC API, and messaging protocols. You’ll learn how to design a variety of APIs, recognize the trade-offs among them, and understand where to use each one for the best communication among applications.
